Using format() with numbers:

format() control the way the number is represented. 
It also controls some of the properties of the resulting string that affect its display.

 formatC() has a format argument that takes a code representing the required format. The most useful are:

"f" for fixed,
"e" for scientific, and
"g" for fixed unless scientific saves space


When using scientific format, the digits argument behaves like it does in format(); 
it specifies the number of significant digits. 
However, unlike format(), when using fixed format, 
digits is the number of digits after the decimal point. 
This is more predictable than format(), because the number of places after the decimal is fixed regardless of the values being formatted.

formatC() also formats numbers individually, which means you always get the same output regardless of other numbers in the vector.

The flag argument allows you to provide some modifiers that,
or example, force the display of the sign (flag = "+"), 
left align numbers (flag = "-") and pad numbers with leading zeros (flag = "0")
