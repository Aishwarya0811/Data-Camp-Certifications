##Escape sequences


 How you get two lines from one string?
 How you get that little globe? 
 
 The key is the \.

A sequence in a string that starts with a \ is called an Escape Sequence 
It allows us to include special characters in our strings. 
NOTE:- \" is used to denote a double quote.

In "hello\n\U1F30D" there are two escape sequences: 
\n gives a newline
\U followed by up to 8 hex digits sequence denotes a particular Unicode character.

Unicode is a standard for representing characters that might not be on your keyboard. 
Each available character has a Unicode code point: a number that uniquely identifies it. 
These code points are generally written in hex notation, that is, using base 16 and the digits 0-9 and A-F. 
You can find the code point for a particular character by looking up a code chart. 
If you only need four digits for the codepoint, an alternative escape sequence is \u.

When R comes across a \ it assumes you are starting an escape, 
so if you actually need a backslash in your string you'll need the sequence \\.
